I'm excited to get this blog started!

*Why bother* you ask?  Well...

*  believe it or not, there are things (mostly in tech) that I've developed opinions on and writing about them helps me solidify those thoughts
*  there are other less important things that I simply don't want to forget (e.g. my favorite bike gear, laptop setup) that *might* be interesting to a few others

A side goal is to play with different frameworks for deploying it.  I don't get to do much with front-end development, so this might be a good outlet to play around with that.

A huge thanks goes out to thanks to some inspiration from my friend [Dan Schreiber](http://www.dan-schreiber.com/).
