Software Engineering Radio has been publishing tech interviews since 2006, making it the longest running podcast in the industry.  They consistently cover a broad source of topics - from deep dives on operating systems to managing teams.  Here are my favorite episodes.

### Episode 216 (2014) - The Modern Cloud-Based Platform

**Guest:** Adrian Cockroft 

You can use cloud as a faster way to do datacenter operations, but that misses most of the benefit.  Much of this is common knowledge right now, but during his time at Netflix, Adrian was one of the first to recognize and explain the new paradigm in a cohesive way. Includes discussions of pets vs. cattle and monoliths vs. microservices. Interviewer Stefan Tilkov does a great job of asking great questions to make this one of the all-time classics. 

### Episode 225 (2015) Systems Performance

**Guest:** Brendan Gregg from Netflix

Brendan is another Netflix guy.  This came at a good time for me when my team was dealing with serious application performance issues that were difficult to track. In particular, I recall getting a lot of mileage out of Brendan's methodology for analyzing performance called [USE](http://www.brendangregg.com/usemethod.html).  This methodology says you just want 3 metrics for each component of your application to zero-in on bottlenecks...

*Utilization* - amount of time component doing work 

*Saturation* - degree a target is overloaded with work (queue length) 

*Errors* - error count

### Episode 256 (2016) Unit Tests

**Guest:** Jay Fields, author

Beyond the "Hello, World" of Unit Testing, author Jay Fields addresses the criticisms that many tests built via TDD are difficult to maintain.  He encourages distinguishing between tests that provide value long-term vs. those that were useful in building a feature, but that you may want to  delete afterwards.  Again, interviewer Stefan Tilkov is a pro at driving the conversation to make this a useful session.

### Episode 287 (2017) Skills for Architects

**Guest:** Neil Ford from ThoughtWorks

I've referred this podcast to several senior engineers who have struggled with moving up the ladder.  Neil explains that at the start of your engineering career, you gain depth in specific areas.  However for architects, often depth of not as valuable as breadth. He addresses the pain involved with giving up some of the expertise in exchange for more breadth.  He also discussed the need to be able to improve presentation skills - expressing yourself both to engineers and business in high-pressure situations.

  

### Episode 332 (2018) Fixing A Broken Development Process 

[http://www.se-radio.net/2018/07/se-radio-episode-332-john-doran-on-fixing-a-broken-development-process/](http://www.se-radio.net/2018/07/se-radio-episode-332-john-doran-on-fixing-a-broken-development-process/)


**Guest:** John Doran, engineering leader

Often when you hear a software team's success story (read: Netflix) they only show you the "after" photo, without explaining the pain involved to get there.  John Doran shows admirable humility in describing his company's journey from a successful but buggy desktop app to SAAS.  Aside from the tech, he talks about the culture shift involved in focusing on automated tests, code reviews and pull requests to improve team collaboration.

### Episode 352 (2019) Scaling Engineering Management

[http://www.se-radio.net/2019/01/se-radio-episode-352-johnathan-nightingale-on-scaling-engineering-management/](http://www.se-radio.net/2019/01/se-radio-episode-352-johnathan-nightingale-on-scaling-engineering-management/)

**Guest:** Johnathan Nightingale, management consultant

How do you move from flat organizations that work for startups, to more hierarchial when that stops working at scale? Johnathan Nightingale argues this is not something to innovate on... and that a small, simple hierarchy can support a large team effectively. Also great advice on onboarding new managers, processes for promotions and setting expectaionts post-promotions, why titles matter, etc.
