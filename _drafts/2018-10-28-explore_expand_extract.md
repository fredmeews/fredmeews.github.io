### Lifespan of a product - a mental model

When [Kent Beck](https://twitter.com/KentBeck) joined Facebook, he was surprised to observe that the teams there were not using an agile development process.  As he describes in a series of talks, he came to the realization that the teams were solving a different problem from those that drove him to pioneer XP/Agile years earlier.  His attempts to understand those differences started with financial investment theory...

**Convex payouts** start with a small investment.  Most times, you will lose the entire investment.  Occasionally though, there is a big payoff..

### Concave Payout

Concave investments require a large investment, but have a predictable ROI.  Occasionally however, there is the risk of a huge loss.

### Software Lifecycle

Bringing the curves together helps describe the lifecycle of a typical software project:  it all starts out with market **exploration**, followed by a spurt of significant **expansion** and finally a stabilization period where a reliable source of revenue can be **extracted** from it.

### Explore

| **FIRST RULE** | Experiment => Feedback => Fail => Repeat |

During Explore, no idea is a bad one.  Failure is expected and is indeed encouraged because we simply don't know what's going to connect in the market.  There's a timer on this phase - after which the money (and market patience) will run out.  The primary goal then is to run as many experiments as possible before then, getting customer feedback as you go, fail, repeat.

If you're working in a place like Silicon Valley, you could spend your entire career working with companies in this phase.

I recall a team I worked on for a new product based on emerging healthcare payer/provider payment models.  The product had a confident visionary with a strong influence over the product design.  In addition, we had a handful of interested "beta" customers at hospitals in different states.

Vision in hand, developers focused on scalable architecture (because of course this thing was gonna be HUUGE) and product managers were focused on minute details of the UI.  As updates to our beta customers slowed to once a month, they eventually lost interest and dropped off one by one.  Eventually the team disbanded.

Exploration takes a certain amount of humility... i.e. admitting "the team is still figuring out what we're building" takes some courage.  In retrospect for this project, we had too much false confidence.  We were playing Expand when we should've been Exploring through frequent release/feedback cycles with our beta customers.


### Expand

| **FIRST RULE** | Keep up with demand by running like hell |
|----------------|------------------------------------------|


| Priority apples | Second priority | Third priority |
|-------|--------|---------|
| ambrosia | gala | red delicious |
| pink lady | jazz | macintosh |
| honeycrisp | granny smith | fuji |




You don't get to decide when you transition from Explore to Expand - the market tells you that you have a winner and it's off to the races!  Your meager Exploration budget grows but so do performance issues.  Scalable software and hardware architecture takes center stage.

Expansion is arguably the most exhilarating phase.  It's the subject of popular books & movies (think Steve Jobs) and you're lucky if you get to experience it a handful of times during your career.   However, it's not all fun... sustainable pace is rarely an option during Expansion as the failure to deliver can mean sudden death.

I recall US-VISIT... for that summer of 2003 the team and I worked every single weekend.  I'd be lying if I said our families didn't suffer in the process.

Work/life balance goes out the window, so it's important to focus the team and avoid the pressure to add new features over scaling what you've got.

### Extract

| **FIRST RULE** | Keep up with demand by running like hell |




Each phase comes with its own risk/rewards that will impact decisions around , so it helps if everyone on the team is in general agreement with the phase you're in.

Each phase of the project 

While this is a simple and arguably subjective view of a project, I find it to be an extremely powerful backdrop for conversations about important decisions for the project - process, staffing, budgets and prioritization.  For Kent, he realized that most of his career working with startups had been in the "explore" phase of projects.  Meanwhile, Facebook was in the Expand/Extract phase.


















It's a crisp Sunday morning as you walk onto the field for a friendly soccer game with friends.  You vaguely your friends are wearing heavy padding and helmets.  You're about to ask a question when someone blows a whistle.  Suddenly, an oblong, brown ball is thrown in your direction.  Befuddled, you instinctively reach out to catch it and are immediately tackled to the ground.

Moral - failure to recognize the game you're in can get you hurt.

### What are the games for software projects?

While no analogy is perfect, this one can also be applied to software projects.  It's dangerous to assume that each of the rules that resulted in success for your last project will apply to your next project.

I heard a talk by Kent Beck in which he describes a mental model detailing 3 phases of a project and the impact each phase has on a team.  What follows is what I culled from Kent's model with examples of each phase from my own experience.

### Extract

| **FIRST RULE** | Be careful! |

Many folks work on projects that are in this phase --- because they're the ones who can afford to hire!





## Explore inside Extract

This is not to say there's no room for exploration in extract projects... it' just that the level of experimentation is not the same.  You're building on your cash cow to see if you can start a new cycle.  This of course doesn't always work... it can be difficult to pivot an Extract culture to a truly Explore one.

### Expand

You'll be lucky to experience this more than once in your career.  One of your ideas catches on in the market.

Catching up with him lately, it was interesting to hear how his views have matured.  With a few years under his belt at Facebook, he was surprised to see that the teams there were working in more of a waterfall approach than agile.  His first thought was "wow - I have a lot of work todo here.... these guys are doing it wrong".... but he later thought "wait... what if these guys are trying to solve a different problem?"

Around the same time he had been reading about

I recently heard a talk from Kent Beck on a mental model for the 3 phases of a project - Explore, Expand and Extract.  These represent a maturation of Beck's views of XP/Agile being the "best way" to run software projects .... based on his experiences at Facebook where he notcied high levels of success, but low levels of Agile adoption.

This was the first time I had heard about the final
