<h2 id="getting-the-gist-of-markdowns-formatting-syntax">Getting the Gist of Markdown’s Formatting Syntax</h2>

<p>This page offers a brief overview of what it’s like to use Markdown.
The <a href="/projects/markdown/syntax" title="Markdown Syntax">syntax page</a> provides complete, detailed documentation for
every feature, but Markdown should be very easy to pick up simply by
looking at a few examples of it in action. The examples on this page
are written in a before/after style, showing example syntax and the
HTML output produced by Markdown.</p>

<p>It’s also helpful to simply try Markdown out; the <a href="/projects/markdown/dingus" title="Markdown Dingus">Dingus</a> is a
web application that allows you type your own Markdown-formatted text
and translate it to XHTML.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> This document is itself written using Markdown; you
can <a href="/projects/markdown/basics.text">see the source for it by adding ‘.text’ to the URL</a>.</p>
